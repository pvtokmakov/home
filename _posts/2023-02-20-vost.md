lead_text: "VOST is a semi-supervised video object segmentation benchmark that focuses on complex object transformations. Differently from existing datasets, objects in VOST are broken, torn and molded into new shapes, dramatically changing their overall appearance. As our experiments demonstrate, this presents a major challenge for the mainstream, appearance-centric VOS methods."
