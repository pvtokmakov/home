lead_text: "Existing approaches for  object discovery rely on appearance cues, such as color, texture and location. However, by relying on appearance alone, these methods fail to reliably separate objects from the background in cluttered scenes. To resolve this ambiguity, in this work we choose to focus on dynamic objects -- entities that are capable of moving independently in the world."
