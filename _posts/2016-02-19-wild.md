lead_text: "In this project we address the problem of long tail category distribution in action detection datasets, both in the training and in the test set. For the former, we introduce a simple but effective approach for transferring knowledge form head to tail classes. For the latter, we propose a new metric which is not biased by the distribution of examples."
