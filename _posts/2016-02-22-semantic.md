lead_text: "Semantic segmentation models require a large amount of expensive, pixel-level annotations to train. We propose to reduce the annotation burden by training the models on weakly-labeled videos and obtaining information about the precise shape of the objects from motion for free. Our model integrates motion cues into a label inference framework in a soft way, which allows to automatically improve the quality of the masks during training. "
