lead_text: "A dominant paradigm for learning-based approaches in computer vision is training generic models on large datasets, and allowing them to discover the optimal representation for the problem at hand. In this work we propose instead to integrate some domain knowledge into the architecture of an action detection model. This allows us to achieves significant improvements over the state-of-the art without much parameter tuning. "
